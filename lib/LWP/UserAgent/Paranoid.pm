=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid;
    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid->new(
        request_timeout => 5   # seconds; may be fractional
    );

    # use $ua as a normal LWP::UserAgent...
    my $response = $ua->get("http://example.com");

    # allow requests to localhost and 127.0.0.1
    $ua->whitelisted_hosts('localhost', '127.0.0.1');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a more modern L<LWPx::ParanoidAgent> with cleaner internals and
a very similar feature set.  It is a not a drop-in replacement, however, since
the API differs.

The primary features provided by this module:

=head2 Overall request timeout

A configurable timeout from start to finish of a "logical" request made by
calling one of L<LWP::UserAgent>'s request methods.  It encompasses all
followed redirects to ensure that you can't be tarpitted by a series of
stalling redirects.  The default is 5 seconds.

=head2 Blocked private hosts and IP address ranges

All new agents are automatically made paranoid of private hostnames and IP
address ranges using L<LWPx::ParanoidHandler>.  You may access the
L<Net::DNS::Paranoid> resolver via the L</resolver> method in order to
customize its behaviour.

For simple whitelisting and blacklisting, you may call L</whitelisted_hosts> or
L</blocked_hosts>.  These methods are proxied to the corresponding methods
of L<Net::DNS::Paranoid>.  The only difference is that you may pass a list to
this class' methods.

=head1 EVEN MORE PARANOIA

You may also wish to tune standard L<LWP::UserAgent> parameters for greater
paranoia depending on your requirements:

=head2 Maximum number of redirects

Although generally unnecessary given the request timeout, you can tune
L<LWP::UserAgent/max_redirects> down from the default of 7.

=head2 Protocols/URI schemes allowed

If you don't want to allow requests for schemes other than http and https, you
may use L<LWP::UserAgent/protocols_allowed> either as a method or as an option
to I<new>.

    $ua->protocols_allowed(["http", "https"]);

=head1 WHY NOT LWPx::ParanoidAgent?

L<LWPx::ParanoidAgent>'s implemention involves a 2009-era fork of LWP's http
and https protocol handlers, and it is no longer maintained.  A more
maintainable approach is taken by this module and L<LWPx::ParanoidHandler>.

=head1 METHODS

All methods from L<LWP::UserAgent> are available via inheritence.  In addition,
the following methods are available:

=head2 request_timeout

Gets/sets the timeout which encapsulates each logical request, including any
redirects which are followed.  The default is 5 seconds.  Fractional seconds
are OK.

=head2 resolver

Gets the DNS resolver which is used to block private hosts.  There is little
need to set your own but if you do it should be an L<Net::DNS::Paranoid>
object.  This attribute is read-only, so if you want to replace the resolver
you need to call L</new> again to create a new L<LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid>.

Use the blocking and whitelisting methods on the resolver, or this class'
L</whitelisted_hosts> and L</blocked_hosts>, to customize the behaviour.

=head2 whitelisted_hosts / blocked_hosts

Accepts a single arrayref and proxies to the method of the same name on the
L</resolver>.  For convenience, you may pass a list which will be passed as an
arrayref to the resolver's method.

"The truth is out there.";

=head1 CAVEATS

The overall request timeout is implemented using SIGALRM.  Any C<$SIG{ALRM}>
handler from an outer scope is replaced in the scope of
L<LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid> requests.
